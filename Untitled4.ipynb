I have burgers 3d equation without viscosity and using PINN (pytorch). you can use initial condition as Shock tube and boundary condition as dirchit. I want to find the solution of burgers equation in this shock. I also want to generate the training data which is noval, you can use monte carlo or other method for this. And finally give me the solution of this. And explain each steps with thoery.\n","\n","you follow all laws and conservations laws during the training data. If yes, then provide me the details"]}]}
